* TLDR
Replace emacs garbage default keybindings with more modern and conventional key bindings.

* Description
Emacs default keybindings are very different from conventional keybindings used in most modern programs and code editors.
This packages tries to teach emacs to be normal and get along with the rest of the world.
It tries to achieve this by replacing the awkward default emacs keybindings using the builtin cua-mode but also expanding on it with more keybindings.

** Allow Emacs to Differentiate escape key from Alt Combinations in Terminal
The following code snippet is used to enable the <escape> key to be recognized by terminal environments
