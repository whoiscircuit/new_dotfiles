#+TITLE: Sane Defaults for Emacs
#+AUTHOR: oxcl
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes
* TLDR
Better and more sane defaults for emacs. 
* Description
some configuration in emacs is just non-sense by default. this package tries to fix that to make emacs more practical and less anoying
* Config

** Performance
These configurations are supposed to improve emacs performance.
Some of these are taken from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/lisp/doom-start.el][doom-emacs source code]].

  ;; spells of inaccurate syntax highlighting right after scrolling, which should
  ;; quickly self-correct.

  (setq idle-update-delay 1.0)  ; default is 0.5


  ;; Font compacting can be terribly expensive, especially for rendering icon
  ;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
  ;; hasn't been determined, but do it anyway, just in case. This increases memory
  ;; usage, however!

  ;; PGTK builds only: there's a timeout that adds latency to frame operations,
  ;; like `make-frame-invisible', which Emacs frequently calls without a guard
  ;; because it's inexpensive in non-PGTK builds. Lowering the timeout from the
  ;; default 0.1 should make childframes and packages that manipulate them (like
  ;; `lsp-ui', `company-box', and `posframe') feel much snappier. See
  ;; emacs-lsp/lsp-ui#613.
