Improves emacs garbage collection perfornamce
* Descripiton
[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/gcmh][Garbage Collector Magic Hack]] is an emacs package which improves emacs garbage collection performance by triggering garbage collection when emacs is inactive for a while (and by assuming you are getting a coffee or something)
this will prevent freezes and stutters by avoiding garbage collection from being triggered at random times.
